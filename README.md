# My first blockchain project

## V2.0
In this version we added the following -
* Added a `SimpleStorage` contract that can store list of `People` with their fav number.
* Added a `SimpleStorageFactory` contract to make creation of `Simplestorage` contract avialabile to everyone.
* With this factory one can create his own storage contract with a list of `People` to work with.
* Also added functionality to `SimpleStorageFactory` to interact with the user created simple storage contract directly.

## V1.0
This version of project does the following things -

* Creates a simple solidity contract.
* Then deploys it on a test network using ReMix.
* The contract itself is a simple storage contract which lets you add indtroduction abt yourself and stores it in a map.
* Builds some fucntions to retrive user intro.
